Simple assembler/emulator for an imaginary Hardware Architecture.

Check out [test.asm](https://github.com/rpasta42/bug-finesser/blob/master/test.asm) for example application for computing fibonacci numbers.

To test it it, run make, and then execute ./a.out test.asm. Currently there isn't any output to screen, but you can see fibinocci number being computed into register 15 in debug output.
